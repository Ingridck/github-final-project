    A calculator that calculates simple interest given principal, annual rate of interest and time period in years.
    REALITY CHECK: this is a useless calculator, as it does not compound the interest over the years, so will 
    underestimate the amount of expected growth.
    
    Input:
       p, principal amount
       t, time period in years
       r, annual rate of interest
    Output
       simple interest = p*t*r
